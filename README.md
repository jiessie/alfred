Invoke a apple script to set the "Display" option.
I modified a nice script from
here[http://fancyham.com/tips/OS_X_toggle_display_rotation_applescript.html]
Pay attention to two things:

1. only setting the external one, I assume that the external one is the last
   screen is "screen List"
2. Button 2 or Button 1, the id may differ in different system, test the script
   and debug the button number please.
